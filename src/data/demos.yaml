    - "This is an animated, interactive lesson about the shape of the universe complete with synchronized audio narration. It's built with Reveal.js, D3 and jQuery (which seriously pulled a ton of weight as an audio engine?!). This project involved a combination of project planning, writing, editing, recording, audio editing, performance testing, cartography and a whole lot of trigonometry."

Hover over an area of the graph to see a breadcrumb of its file path, along with how much space it is taking up. If something seems to be taking up a large amount of space, click on it to zoom in and get a more detailed look."

      This is another AI experiment, this time using a game called [Aristotle's puzzle](http://www.amazon.com/Aristotles-Number-Classic-Wooden-Puzzle/dp/B0085JRADS). The game is built using React, Redux and React Hot Loader. The AI uses a fairly brute-force approach, the challenge came in making the validation as predictive as possible in order to reduce the number of brute force tries the computer would attempt.

    - "After my visit to the LHC in August 2015, I was inspired to make this fairly rough sketch that I may use later in a lesson about Quantum Mechanics. The two colored blobs can be dragged together, causing them to combine into a single purple blob. However, the two blobs are discrete, and can be separated by multitouch gestures even though they seem homogenous when combined."

    - "This lesson prototype presents the student with a simple arithmetic problem. They can solve the problem by dragging one digit on top of another and performing operations on the \"combined\" digits. When they are done, a teacher can \"play back\" their work and see all the steps that were taken to get to the answer playing in realtime."

Atoms and molecules can be manipulated with multitouch gestures, with bonds breaking if they are stretched too far. The amount of stretching required varies with the energy of the bond."

      Another next generation lesson prototype. This one is based on the awesome work by [ThoughtCafe](http://thoughtcafe.ca/) in the Crash Course World History lesson, the [Monsoon Marketplace](https://youtu.be/a6XtBLDmPA0?t=139). Clicking or tapping on any of the cities will animate you into an article about the city and its role in the economic trade of the time (content from Wikipedia). Clicking the links to other cities will take you back to the map, where you'll be \"transported\" to the article about that city.

      A prototype for a new kind of geography lesson using D3. As you scroll to each country's section of the lesson, the globe swivels to show that country. This demo is built using content from the Wikipedia pages about the BRICS countries, Mike Bostock's [World Tour](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330) demo and a JQuery plugin called [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/)

      This was a fork of [λ Lessons](https://stevekrouse.github.io/hs.js/), a project by Jan Paul Posma and Steve Krouse. I \"redecorated\" the function editor so that each function application was a bubble, which could be \"popped\" to reveal the result. This was a lot of fun to make, and managed to land on the front page of Hacker News as well as /r/haskell

      I forked Gabe Cirulli's hit game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) to try to see if I could write an AI that would play the game. The resulting project taught me a lot about minimax algorithms and the limits of JavaScript performance (especially if you try to run the AI on mobile).
