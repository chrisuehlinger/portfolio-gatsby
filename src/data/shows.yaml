      This was a fully-online interactive piece of theatre produced during (and as a response to) the COVID-19 Pandemic. I built a platform that allowed audiences to fly around a 3D solar system in groups of 5, interacting with characters played by actors from across the east coast, all acting out of their own houses on their own devices using whatever they had available for setting, props and costumes. The apps involved had to work on desktop, tablet and even mobile browsers (many actors were using phones since they have better webcams) and had to adapt to changing network conditions and unpredictable user device constraints. This is the most technological complicated project I've ever worked on, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.

    - "This show consisted of about 50 sketch-length pieces about communication and relationships in the digital age. Some of these pieces were accompanied by projections, some involved live communication between onstage and projected offstage actors via WebRTC, others were completely filmed and then edited by me, one of them involved coating the walls with nebulae using 7 projectors driven by Raspberry Pis."

    - "Tech: WebGL, WebRTC, ARKit, Electron, OSC (over Websockets)"
    - "This was an excellent locally written musical and was my first time working with the BROS. My main contribution was the portal between our world and Shakesville, which I built using an open source WebGL fluid simulator. I also built a live video monitoring system that could run over the LAN using WebRTC and the Janus media server, which allowed the band (who were backstage) to see what was happening onstage and take their cues. Towards the end of the run I introduced an ARKit-based effect that allowed the Deputy Mayor (the show's supervillain) to perform her first song of the show via live motion capture."

    - "This was a locally written one-man show about the cult leader Jim Jones. It featured heavy use of sequences I built using Adobe After Effects (this was my first time using it), as well as one effect where I captured live video of the character from an iPhone embedded in his pulpit, streamed it over the Wifi via WebRTC and projected it behind him for a sort of \"Wizard of Oz\" effect. I hadn't yet heard about software like QLab, so for this show I build my own cueing webapp using Express and Websockets."

    - "Tech: ARKit, WebRTC, WebGL, and Neural Style Transfer applied to old scifi movies"
    - "I got my start in Projection work creating an effect using ARKit that allowed the actor playing Magenta to perform a pre-show monologue as the iconic Lips from the Rocky Horror Picture Show via live motion capture. I later built a video sequence for Science Fiction/Double Feature using clips from the mentioned movies but thrown through a Neural Style Transfer algorithm, as well as a 3D sequence built with Three.js and one short moment where we cut to a webcam pointed at the audience."
