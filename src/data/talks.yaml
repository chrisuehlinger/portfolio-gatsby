      This talk was based on [my blog post of the same name](/blog/2020/06/16/unshattering-the-audience-building-theatre-on-the-web-in-2020), and was a quick run-through of how I built the software that ran Shattered Space. I don't have a video of this one, and my slides are a bit incomplete (it was heavily demo-focused), so I'd recommend checking out the [blog post](/blog/2020/06/16/unshattering-the-audience-building-theatre-on-the-web-in-2020) instead."

      At this point I had only done projections for two shows (Rocky and Thank You, Dad) but a lot of the concepts I cover in here (particularly ARKit and basic WebRTC stuff) formed the basis for a lot of my future projections work as well. [This is also the only talk I've done that was recorded at the meetup where it was given, so I recommend checking that out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AXFH11t6vg)."

    - "This talk was a response to that whole thing where Facebook changed up the licensing of React (and other projects) in a way that created a lot of confusion about people's liability. Many people working in software have only a cursory knowledge of how software IP works, so it felt like a good time to review the basics of IP law and how it affects us. In a blistering 25 minutes I rampaged through the concepts of Copyright, Fair Use, Licenses, Patents, Patent Grants and then the issues surrounding Facebook's actions and what they meant (spoiler: it's a bit unclear but it might be fine but I am not your lawyer)."

    - "D3 is an incredible tool that many developers find intimidating at first. This talk was a basic tutorial in making a bar chart in D3, but with a focus on how you don't need to understand all of D3 in order to be very proficient in using it. I also highlighted the awesome amount of examples on bl.ocks.org and how you could use them as both inspiration and as a starting point for your own visualizations."

I began with a supercut of some of the amazing stuff the community has made and then went on to a walkthrough of the official Three.js tutorial, showing the results of each step and explaining how each of the new vocabulary terms (Geometry, Materials, Textures, etc.) relate to each other."

      This is a talk I've given at charmCityJS and the Loyola University ACM series ([which was recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljJVzaW8xuk)). It's about my experience teaching programming in Thailand, and some of the lessons I learned that helped me become a better teacher and communicator."
